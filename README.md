# Computing Algorithm Activity Items

* Dictionary: Given a word, we need to transform it on the top rung (e.g. THINK) into the word on the bottom rung (e.g. SMART) in the least number of steps. During each step, you must replace one letter in the previous word so that a new word is formed, but without changing the positions of the other letters.
* FindRectangle: Given the x,y co-ordinates for two rectangle inputs, produce true or false depending on if they overlap or not.
* Max Clique: Find the maximal clique within a given graph. A maximal clique is a clique that cannot be extended by including one more adjacent vertex
